- Code Assistant Used: Github Copilot
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Why? GitHub Copilot is one of the most powerful AI tools available for coding. Its seamless integration with Visual Studio Code makes it an excellent option for enhancing coding efficiency by providing real-time code suggestions and completions based on the context of your current code. Also, is free for students.
- How did it help me? GitHub Copilot significantly increased my productivity by reducing tasks that would have taken a few hours to less than one hour. It provides great suggestions based on what you are doing, and it even enhances developers' abilities by allowing them to produce software without fully understanding or mastering a technology. While not a best practice, this can be useful in extreme situations.
